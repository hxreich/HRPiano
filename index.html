                    <h class="title">Wandering</h>
                    <p>This is my favorite piece so far. I recorded it on a whim with my piano at home. While playing I envisioned someone exploring nature alone, forging their own path, and since it was winter time I decided to accompany the music with visuals of snow and ice.  </p>

                    <h class="title">No Clue</h>
                    <p>This is my first published original piano composition which I made for an intro music class in college. This was actually a collaboration with one of my friends. I got her to play something on the piano which formed the melody, and I added form and structure to it. Since it was a collaboration between the two of us I asked her what to name the piece and she said, "No Clue".</p>
